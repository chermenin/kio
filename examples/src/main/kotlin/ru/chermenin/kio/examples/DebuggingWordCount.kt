/**
 * An example that verifies word counts in Shakespeare.
 *
 * Note: this and other examples are ported from the Beam's examples written in Kotlin.
 *
 *
 * This class, [DebuggingWordCount], is the third in a series of four successively more
 * detailed 'word count' examples. You may first want to take a look at [MinimalWordCount] and
 * [WordCount]. After you've looked at this example, then see the [WindowedWordCount]
 * pipeline, for introduction of additional concepts.
 *
 *
 * Basic concepts, also in the MinimalWordCount and WordCount examples:
 * - reading text files;
 * - counting a PCollection;
 * - executing a Pipeline both locally and using a selected runner;
 * - defining DoFns.
 *
 *
 * New Concepts:
 * 1. Logging using SLF4J, even in a distributed environment
 * 2. Creating a custom metric (runners have varying levels of support)
 * 3. Testing your pipeline
 *
 *
 * To change the runner, specify: `--runner=YOUR_SELECTED_RUNNER`.
 *
 *
 * The input file defaults to a public data set containing the text of of King Lear, by William
 * Shakespeare. You can override it and choose your own input with `--input`.
